# An app that displays X Formation's public repositories' and contributors' statistics

The application is also available at https://204constie.github.io/appa (repository including only the 'app' folder of the current repository: https://github.com/204Constie/appa) but works properly only if the proxy server is set.

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

## Run

Assuming you have *git*, *npm* and *grunt* installed:
* clone into your local repository
* change directory to forlder *server* and run from terminal (this runs proxy server)
```
node index.js
```
* go back to folder *anApp* and run from terminal with (or visit https://204constie.github.io/appa)
```
grunt serve
```
